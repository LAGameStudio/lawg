Lost Astronaut's WEB Game Creation Framework
--------------------------------------------

A carefully selected series of Javascript frameworks, wrapped in a useful common library facilitating easy HTML5 game development in ways
similar to [http://github.com/LAGameStudio/apolune](Lost Astronaut Game Creation Framework) but also extensible using any 3rd party engine,
including THREEjs, PixiJS, Phaser, and others.

Designed to be cross-platform friendly, and leveraging web platform middleware, you can create complex 2D and 3D and 2.5D games using some
of the best open source.

LAWG leverages its own interface to provide multiple-engine and HTML coexistance.

Using [http://github.com/h3rb/galvanic](Galvanic) or [http://github.com/h3rb/papi] you can create multiplayer and cloud-based back-ends easily with JSON RESTful web APIs.
