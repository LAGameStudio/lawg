#### Lost Astronaut's WEB Game Creation Framework

A carefully selected series of Javascript frameworks, wrapped in a useful common library facilitating easy HTML5 game development in ways
similar to (http://github.com/LAGameStudio/apolune)[Lost Astronaut Game Creation Framework] but also extensible using any 3rd party engine,
including THREEjs, PixiJS, Phaser, and others.

Designed to be cross-platform friendly, and leveraging web platform middleware, you can create complex 2D and 3D and 2.5D games using some
of the best open source.

LAWG leverages its own interface to provide multiple-engine and HTML coexistence.  This means that useful infrastructure for doing complex
multi-canvas and overlay-HTML interfaces is possible.  It also provides some unification for touch interfaces along with the mouse and
game controllers.  And, it provides its own HTML5 canvas engine similar to the features of the Lost Astronaut Game Creation Framework in C++.

Using [Galvanic](http://github.com/h3rb/galvanic) or [Papi](http://github.com/h3rb/papi) you can create multiplayer and cloud-based back-ends easily with JSON RESTful web APIs.
